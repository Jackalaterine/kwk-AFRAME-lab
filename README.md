# Creating a basic scene...
##### Using the A-Frame documentation we're going to build out a scene using 
* 3D primitives (shapes)
* Textures
* Animation
* Lighting
* Text
* Background 
* and Sound

You will follow the instructions on the page linked below. The "Parent and Child Transforms" section is optional, you may want to skim through it, but the information is not essential to create the scene. When you reach the animation step, skip over the "Event Listener Component (Intermediate)" section and continue directly to "Animating on Events". Once you finish the entire scene, it may be useful to go back and read over this section as we will be covering this material tomorrow.

##### I finished my scene!
Wooo! Congratulations, you've just made your first VR scene. Preview your scene and pop it out into its own tab. Copy and paste the url on this preview page and use <https://goo.gl/> to create a shortened link. Request a pair of VR goggles from one of the teachers. Use the samsung internet app in the library section and enter in your shortened URL to view your 3D scene. Click on the goggles in the bottom right corner to enter goggles mode. 
If you want more to do...
